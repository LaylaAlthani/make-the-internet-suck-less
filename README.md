# Make the internet suck less

Here's the deal, the internet is full of shit. Let's make it go away.

All the sites that make everything horrible. Any site that you can't help going to like you're picking at a scab that won't heal. That's what I want to block.

Pull requests are welcome. When I'm feeling more ambitious, I'll write a bash script to concatenate the text files and write them to `/etc/hosts`

Until then, copy and paste what you want into your own `/etc/hosts` file. See the someone-who-cares.txt file for a great explanation of how to modify your hosts file.
